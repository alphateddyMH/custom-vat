EDD Custom VAT per Country enables product-specific and country-specific VAT rates for Easy Digital Downloads. This plugin allows you to set different VAT rates for each product and country, making it perfect for businesses that sell digital products with varying tax rates across different regions.

## Description

EDD Custom VAT per Country gives you complete control over your VAT rates on a per-product and per-country basis. This is particularly useful for businesses selling digital products in the EU, where different VAT rates may apply to different types of products.

For example, in Germany, e-books are taxed at 7% while standard digital products are taxed at 19%. With this plugin, you can easily set these different rates for each product.

### Key Features

- **Product-Specific VAT Rates**: Set different VAT rates for each product and country
- **Intuitive UI**: Easy-to-use interface for managing VAT rates directly in the product editor
- **Bundle Support**: Proper handling of bundles with products that have different tax rates
- **Recurring Payments**: Full support for EDD Recurring Payments with consistent tax rates
- **GoBD Compliance**: Detailed tax breakdowns in invoices for GoBD compliance
- **Import/Export**: Export and import your VAT rate configurations
- **WPML Compatible**: Works seamlessly with multilingual stores
- **Gateway Integration**: Correctly passes tax information to payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe

### How It Works

1. Enable the countries you want to use custom VAT rates for
2. Edit a product and set specific VAT rates for each country
3. When a customer purchases the product, the correct VAT rate is applied based on their country

If no custom rate is defined for a product/country combination, the default EDD tax rate will be used.
